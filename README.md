# chesstrainer

This is a chess trainer program.  It shows chess puzzles and will track results.  
The ultimate goal is for a coach to send you puzzles and assess your results.

It's a pet project at this time and is built using Dart and Flutter.  It is designed
to work on Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Web platforms.

I intend to add support for StockFish and integrate it into chess.com and lichess.org
so it can download and analyze games.  Then share all that information with a chess
coach via a Firebase database.
